# Pillar 5: Change Management

**$3 change management for every $1 AI development**

---

## Overview

Change Management is the human side of JBOT Protocol—driving adoption, building skills, and measuring success. The technology is the easy part; changing how people work is the real challenge.

## Core Principles

### 5.1 The 3:1 Investment Ratio

For every dollar spent on AI development, plan to spend three dollars on:

- **Training** — Building skills and confidence
- **Communication** — Explaining the why and the how
- **Support** — Helping people through the transition
- **Iteration** — Refining based on feedback

### 5.2 The Adoption Curve

    title JBOT Protocol Adoption Timeline
    section Pilot
        Week 1-2 : Deploy first agent (read-only)
                 : Document top 3 processes
        Week 3-4 : Validate agent accuracy
                 : Promote to assisted actions
    section Adoption
        Month 2 : Team begins daily use
               : Feedback collection
               : Iterate on agent instructions
    section Expansion
        Month 3-4 : Add second division
                  : Cross-division workflows
                  : Build dashboard
    section Optimization
        Ongoing : Continuous improvement
               : Measure ROI quarterly
               : Scale to all divisions
```

### 5.3 Stakeholder Mapping

| Stakeholder Type | Primary Concern | Key Message |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Executives | ROI, risk | Strategic advantage, governance |
| Managers | Team productivity | Augmentation, not replacement |
| Individual Contributors | Job security | New skills, higher-value work |
| IT/Security | System integrity | Controls, compliance |

#### RACI Matrix: Who Does What

| Activity | Executive Sponsor | Division Owners | Individual Contributors | IT / Security |
|----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Architecture Design** | A | R | C | C |
| **Knowledge Capture** | I | A | R | C |
| **Tool Integration** | I | C | C | R |
| **Governance Policy** | A | R | C | R |
| **Training Development** | I | A | R | C |
| **Pilot Program** | A | R | R | C |
| **Go-Live Decision** | A | R | C | C |
| **Ongoing Operations** | I | R | R | C |
| **Security Reviews** | I | C | I | R |
| **Performance Monitoring** | I | R | C | C |

**R** = Responsible (does the work) | **A** = Accountable (makes the call) | **C** = Consulted | **I** = Informed

**Key insight:** Division Owners (managers) are the linchpin. They are Responsible or Accountable for 7 of 10 activities. If they don't buy in, adoption stalls — regardless of executive sponsorship.
