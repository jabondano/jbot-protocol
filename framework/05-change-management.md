# Pillar 5: Change Management

**$3 change management for every $1 AI development**

---

## Overview

Change Management is the human side of JBOT Protocol—driving adoption, building skills, and measuring success. The technology is the easy part; changing how people work is the real challenge.

## Core Principles

### 5.1 The 3:1 Investment Ratio

For every dollar spent on AI development, plan to spend three dollars on:

- **Training** — Building skills and confidence
- **Communication** — Explaining the why and the how
- **Support** — Helping people through the transition
- **Iteration** — Refining based on feedback

### 5.2 The Adoption Curve
