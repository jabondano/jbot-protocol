# Pillar 1: Division Architecture

**Flat networks of human-supervised AI teams**

---

## Overview

Division Architecture is the practice of mapping an organization's structure to enable effective AI agent deployment. Rather than hierarchical command chains, JBOT Protocol favor flat networks where AI agents work alongside humans within clearly defined domains.

## Core Principles

### 1.1 Division Mapping

Every organization consists of divisions—functional areas with distinct responsibilities, knowledge domains, and workflows. Before deploying AI agents, you must understand:

- **Division boundaries** — Where does one team's responsibility end and another's begin?
- **Decision authority** — Who approves what? Where are the bottlenecks?
- **Information flows** — How does knowledge move between divisions?
- **Dependencies** — Which divisions rely on outputs from others?

### 1.2 Agent-Team Topology

<!-- TODO: Expand with diagrams and examples -->

AI agents should be deployed as members of existing teams, not as separate "AI departments." Key considerations:

- **One division, one (or more) specialized agents**
- **Clear human supervision chains**
- **Defined escalation paths**

### 1.3 The "Pizza Team" Principle

<!-- TODO: Add metrics and case studies -->

AI teams should follow the same sizing principles as effective human teams:

- Small enough for tight coordination
- Specialized enough for deep expertise
- Connected enough to the broader organization

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Complete division inventory
- [ ] Map reporting structures and decision authority
- [ ] Identify high-volume, repetitive workflows per division
- [ ] Define agent roles and human oversight requirements
- [ ] Establish cross-division communication protocols

## Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Hub and Spoke

<!-- TODO: Detail this pattern -->

A central operations agent coordinates with specialized division agents.

### Pattern B: Mesh Network

<!-- TODO: Detail this pattern -->

Peer-to-peer agent communication with human checkpoints.

### Pattern C: Hierarchical Hybrid

<!-- TODO: Detail this pattern -->

Traditional reporting structure with AI augmentation at each level.

## Deliverables

1. **Division Map** — Visual representation of organizational structure
2. **Agent Placement Plan** — Where agents will be deployed
3. **Supervision Matrix** — Human oversight assignments
