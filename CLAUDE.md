## About This Repository

This is the intellectual property repository for **JBOT Protocol**, a consulting methodology developed by Joaquin Abondano. The content here represents proprietary frameworks, templates, and processes for helping organizations integrate AI agents into their operations.

## Purpose

When working with this codebase, understand that:

1. **This is consulting IP** - The frameworks and templates are the core deliverables for client engagements
2. **Quality matters** - Documentation should be clear, professional, and actionable

### The Five Pillars of JBOT Protocol

1. **Division Architecture** - How to map an organization's structure for AI integration
2. **Knowledge Capture** - Methods for documenting processes, systems, and expertise
3. **Tool Integration** - Connecting AI agents to business systems (APIs, MCPs, webhooks)
4. **Governance** - Guardrails, permissions, human-in-the-loop requirements
5. **Change Management** - Adoption strategies, training, success metrics
